PROJECT 1 — Multi-Tool Agentic RAG System
Business Problem Solved:

Built an agentic GenAI system to answer telecom plan queries from multiple heterogeneous data sources (static text, structured tables, policy documents) by dynamically selecting tools, aggregating context, and generating accurate responses.

Domain: Telecom Plan Intelligence & Customer Support Automation

Approach:

Designed a planner-based multi-tool agent architecture using:

Planner Agent: Uses LLaMA-3.2 to analyze user intent and select appropriate tools.

Final Response Agent: Uses Gemma-3 to synthesize final answer.

Semantic Retrieval: MiniLM embeddings for similarity search.

Vector Search: FAISS for chunk retrieval.

Structured Querying: DuckDB for SQL-based data filtering.

Tool Architecture:

Tool 1 & 2 — Static Text Retrieval

Directly fetch telecom plan details from text files.

No embeddings or SQL required.

Tool 3 — Structured Plan Database (SQL-based Retrieval)

Flow:

User Question
↓
LLM generates SQL
↓
SQL executed via DuckDB
↓
Filtered table → converted to text using LLM
↓
Final user-friendly response

👉 No embeddings used for structured data — purely NL → SQL → Table → Text.

Tool 4 — Hierarchical RAG Retrieval

Flow:

Query
↓
URL Selection using embeddings
↓
Chunk Retrieval via FAISS

First selects relevant webpage.

Then retrieves most relevant chunks only.

Overall Agent Flow:

User Query
↓
Planner Agent (Tool Selection)
↓
Selected Tools Execute
↓
Context Aggregation
↓
Final Response Agent
↓
User Answer

Why This Approach:

Enables dynamic tool orchestration

Avoids unnecessary RAG when structured SQL works better

Reduces hallucination via factual context aggregation

Improves accuracy and scalability across multiple data formats

Deployment:

On-premise deployment with modular microservices

FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval

DuckDB embedded analytical database

Containerized inference pipelines

Outcome:

Improved response accuracy by combining multi-source context

Reduced hallucinations through tool-grounded reasoning

Enabled scalable telecom knowledge querying system

Tools Used:

Python, LLaMA-3.2, Gemma-3, MiniLM, FAISS, DuckDB, RAG Architecture, Agentic AI, Multi-Tool Orchestration, NL-to-SQL, Context Aggregation

✅ PROJECT 2 — MCP Guardrail Middleware for Leadership Summarization System
Business Problem Solved:

Leadership dashboard generated telecom call summaries using Gemini model with dynamic business instructions.

Major risk identified:

No validation for leadership-added prompts

No validation for generated summaries

Potential sensitive data leakage & compliance risks

Solution: Implemented MCP-based guardrail middleware without modifying core LLM logic.

Approach:

Introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a plug-and-play guardrail layer.

MCP Exposed Two Validation Tools:

Tool 1 — Prompt Validation Tool

Validates leadership-added instructions

Ensures compliance and policy safety before appending to default prompt

Tool 2 — Response Validation Tool

Validates generated summaries for:

Sensitive data leakage

Hallucinations

Policy violations

System Flow:

Leadership Instructions
↓
MCP Prompt Validation Tool
↓
Validated Prompt sent to LLM
↓
Gemini generates summary
↓
MCP Response Validation Tool
↓
Safe Leadership Dashboard Output

Why This Approach:

No changes to existing LLM pipelines

External plug-and-play guardrail system

Independent scalability

Maintains business flexibility while ensuring compliance

Deployment:

Stateless MCP microservice

Containerized using Docker

Pushed to Amazon ECR

Deployed on AWS App Runner

Scales independently from LLM system

Outcome:

Closed major compliance loopholes

Prevented sensitive telecom data exposure

Enabled safe dynamic prompt customization

Improved enterprise governance of AI outputs

Tools Used:

MCP (Model Context Protocol), Gemini LLM, AWS App Runner, Amazon ECR, Docker, Prompt Validation, Response Guardrails, Enterprise AI Compliance
